## sijuiacion-lang

Sijuiacion, a.k.a "橘势", is a programming language to achieve a better use of
a subset of of the CPython bytecode instructions.

It provides some useful high level instructions, e.g, the Indirect Jumps,
and the Switch instructions, that are much more efficient than stacked if-else statements.

This idea is not originated by me, and I even just heard(got introduced about)
this from someone else. I must appreciate him for bringing me how to
use `END_FINALLY` to achieve this "fast switch" in Python, but I really really hate him.
