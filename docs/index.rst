Features of sijuiacion:

- No similar framework so far in the whole Python world, but needed for many compiler stuffs.
- Compiling to stand-alone :code:`.pyc` file.
- Providing **Label as Values**, indirect jump, switch instructions for advanced language constructs.
- Taking advantage of Python's error reporting mechanisms by providing metadata.
- Generalising Python constants other than only marshallable python objects, by link time processing.
